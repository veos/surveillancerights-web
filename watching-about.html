                    <h2>Who is Watching YOU? And Why?</h2>
                    
    
                    <p>The growth of video surveillance systems and their ongoing augmentation by biometric and smart surveillance algorithms has significant implications for the privacy of all Canadians.  The growth of ICT networks and developments in biometric technologies, such as face recognition, expand the potential uses of video surveillance data and make it increasingly important for Canadians to know their personal information rights.  What is needed is an ‘audit’ of Canadian attitudes and contexts in order to ground further research and public education outreach on video surveillance in Canada.</p>
                    <p>Recent OPC funded research (Clement et al, 2010) on private sector compliance with PIPEDA indicates widespread ignorance of the most basic requirements for video surveillance practices.  It seems clear that, in Canada, the private sector is either unaware of legislative requirements, or choose to interpret their responsibilities as narrowly as possible with respect to privacy guidelines for video surveillance.  This situation where surveillance practices and technologies have outpaced policy and awareness presents not only an opportunity for research, but also one for public outreach and education.  A range of studies have been done internationally and in Canada around the deployment and efficacy of video surveillance (2011), while in Canada, foundational research has begun on video surveillance practices and policy (see: Dawson et al., 2009; Deisman et al., 2009).   None of these studies, however, ask what Canadians know about video surveillance practices and policy.</p>
                    <p>This research aims to answer the following questions:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>What do Canadians know about video surveillance policy, practices and technology?</li>
                        <li>What do Canadians know about the implications of current developments in video surveillance and video analysis technologies?</li>
                        <li>What are Canadian attitudes towards video surveillance policy and regulation in Canada?</li>
                    </ul>
                    
                    <p>And perhaps more significantly:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Do Canadians care about the privacy implications of current video information practices and their implications for individual visual privacy?</li>
                    </ul>
                    
                    <p>This research fills an existing knowledge gap, and will provide researchers, governments and industry a snapshot to inform future research and policy in the unique Canadian context.</p>

                    
                    
                    <h3>Goals</h3>
                        <p>The “Video Surveillance and Privacy” project combines citizen-perspective focused research and public education in the expanding arena of visual surveillance and consumer privacy. The overarching goal of the project is to find out what people understand about the recent developments in video surveillance associated with the introduction of digital techniques, what concerns they express, and where information gaps exist, in order to ground ongoing Canadian research in visual surveillance and privacy policies, and to inform the development of public education about this topic.  This research is conducted on the assumption that the potential uses of visual surveillance data need to be made more transparent, and organizations using these technologies need to be more accountable to Canadians in protecting their privacy rights.</p>
