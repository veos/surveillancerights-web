				<h2>Frequently Asked Questions</h2>
				
        
                                   
                                        <h5>1. I don’t have a Google Play account, can I use the SurveillanceWatch app? </h5>
                                        <p id="faqindent">You can download the most current APK for our app (version 2.2.3) <a href="downloads/SurveillanceWatch_2.2.3.apk">here</a>. As the app is currently in beta, we’re planning many changes over the next few months. Please check back for updates! </p>

                                        <h5>2. I have an iPhone or iPad, can I use the SurveillanceWatch app? </h5>
                                        <p id="faqindent">You can use the app in a browser on your iPhone or iPad (<a href="http://mobile.watch.surveillancerights.ca" target="_blank">click here to launch</a>). <br>
                                            Here are a couple of tips to get you started:</p>
                                            <ul>
                                               <!-- <li>the buttons on the map view are obscured - tap the button on the left to Report on a surveillance installation, and tap the button on the right to view all installations in a List</li>-->
                                                <li><strong>iOS 5.1.1 and older:</strong> you won’t be able to include photos in your reports - this is due to restrictions in place on the iPhone file system. You may, however, take photos of any installations you see and then upload those photos later, from a web browser on a desktop or laptop computer. </li>
                                                <li><strong>iOS 6:</strong> you may take new photos when creating a report, or you may select a photo that is already stored on your device.</li>
                                            </ul>
                                        <h5>3. I don’t have a smart phone, can I use the SurveillanceWatch app? </h5>
                                        <p id="faqindent">You can use the app in any web browser (<a href="http://mobile.watch.surveillancerights.ca" target="_blank">click here to launch</a>). When adding a new installation or editing an existing one, photos already on the computer can be uploaded.</p>

                                

                                        <h5>4. What is an Installation? </h5>
                                        <p id="faqindent">An Installation (short for “Surveillance Installation”) consists of one or more surveillance cameras monitoring a particular space for a particular owner. <br>Some examples of installations are: </p>
                                            <ul>
                                                <li>a pair of police cameras monitoring an intersection</li>
                                                <li>multiple cameras monitoring the space outside of a bank or a shopping centre</li>
                                                <li>a single camera monitoring the entrance to a store</li>
                                            </ul>

                                        <h5>5. What’s the difference between an Owner and an Operator? </h5>
                                        <p id="faqindent"><strong>Owner:</strong> the entity who owns or manages the property that the surveillance is attached to. This could be the name of a restaurant, store, bank, school, government agency, property manager, etc. </p>
                                        <p id="faqindent"><strong>Operator:</strong> any 3rd party security company (such as Chubb) that may be monitoring the cameras. Sometimes these companies are mentioned on signs.</p> 
    
                                        <h5>6. I see I can include photos in my reports. What makes for a good photo? </h5>
                                        <p id="faqindent">We are looking for photos that show:</p>
                                            <ul>
                                                <li>surveillance cameras overlooking public spaces. It’s good if we can clearly see the camera and get a sense of the sort of space it overlooks. </li>
                                                <li>any signs that mention the surveillance. Close up, in-focus shots that allow us to read the sign are ideal. </li>
                                                <li>the distance between the sign(s) and the camera(s). Are they close together or far apart? Is the sign clearly visible to everyone who walks by, or is it tucked away behind a plant or in the corner of a window? </li>
                                            </ul>

                                        <p id="faqindent">Please avoid uploading photos where people’s faces are recognizable.</p>

                                    <h5>7. I uploaded a photo but now it’s gone. What happened? </h5>
                                    <p id="faqindent">It may have included someone’s face - we avoid using photographs that capture people’s images without their consent. <br>
                                        Or, it may have been in violation of our <a href="termsofuse.html" target="_blank">Terms of Use</a>. </p>

                                    <h5>8. I’m using SurveillanceWatch in a browser. Why does it keep asking for my location? </h5>
                                    <p id="faqindent">Our app provides a location-based service, to allow you to report on the location of surveillance installations. The default location in any new report is based on your GPS coordinates - you can override this default by entering an address or choosing a different point on the map. If you’re running the app in a web browser, you will be asked to give the app permission to use your location. If this happens repeatedly you can try choosing the ‘Always Share Location’ option, if one is available. </p>

                                    <h5>9. What should I type in the Notes section?</h5>
                                    <p id="faqindent">You can use the Notes to tell us anything you think is interesting about the installation. What direction are the cameras pointed? Is it in a high traffic area - are a lot of people’s images captured by these cameras every day? If you couldn’t take a photo, you can describe the installation here. <br>
We’d also like to hear about your experience collecting this information. </p>
